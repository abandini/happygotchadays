# HappyGotchaDays.com - Claude Code Orchestration Prompt

## Project Thesis

Build a joyful, user-friendly platform for pet owners to celebrate and share their dogs' and cats' adoption anniversaries ("gotcha days"). The site will enable pet parents to create profiles, upload photos, share stories, and connect with a community of fellow rescue pet adopters. The platform celebrates the 4.2 million annual pet adoptions in the US, serving the 81% of pet parents who actively celebrate these milestones.

**Core Values:**
- Celebrate rescue and adoption as life-changing moments for pets
- Build community around pet adoption stories
- Focus exclusively on companion animals (dogs/cats) - NO human adoption content
- Create shareable, social-media-friendly experiences
- Leverage Cloudflare's edge compute and AI capabilities for performance and features

**Technical Foundation:**
- Cloudflare Workers (NOT Pages) for edge compute
- D1 for relational data
- R2 for image/media storage
- KV for caching and session management
- Secrets for API keys and sensitive data
- Worker AI for image analysis, content moderation, story enhancement
- GitHub as single source of truth with automated deployments

---

Storage: R2 (images, videos)
Cache: KV (sessions, frequently accessed data)
AI: Workers AI (image tagging, content suggestions)
Auth: Custom JWT implementation using Secrets
Deploy: GitHub Actions â†’ Wrangler
```

## Final Note

This project celebrates the joy pets bring to our lives through adoption. Every line of code should reflect that joy while maintaining professional standards. Build something that makes pet parents smile when they visit, that loads fast, works on any device, and creates a warm community around rescue pets.

Focus exclusively on companion animals (dogs and cats). This is about celebrating happy pets in loving homes.
